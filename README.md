I spend my days keeping financial systems alive (production support, incident triage, Control-M, ServiceNow, SQL) — and my evenings building things that shouldn't exist yet.

## 🛠 What I Build

### 🛡️ [SentinelWatch](https://github.com/azaurov/sentinelwatch) — AI Process Monitor
> *Electron · Node.js · Anthropic Claude API · PowerShell · ps aux*

Cross-platform desktop app that polls live OS processes every 5 seconds, detects hangs via CPU-delta analysis over configurable windows, and surfaces **Claude AI-generated triage recommendations** on demand — with one-click process kill. Works on Windows (PowerShell `Get-Process`) and Linux/macOS (`ps aux`). Secure `contextIsolation` IPC architecture.

---

### 🤖 [AI Resume & Cover Letter Builder](https://github.com/azaurov/resume-builder) — Claude-Powered PWA
> *React · Vite · Node.js/Express · Anthropic Claude API · Prompt Caching*

Full-stack PWA that reads your profile + a job description and generates a tailored resume and cover letter in under 60 seconds. Features live token tracking, a debug panel, and PDF export. Prompt caching cuts API latency significantly on repeat calls.

---

### 📱 [DoomscrollGuard](https://github.com/azaurov/doomscrollguard) — Android Accessibility App
> *Kotlin · Android SDK · AccessibilityService · ViewBinding · Material 3 · Firebase*

Production-quality Android app (Kotlin, ViewBinding, Material 3) using `AccessibilityService` to detect doomscrolling via a sliding-window scroll-event counter across 13 tracked social media apps. Fires a `NotificationCompat` alert mirrored to an Amazfit GTR 3 via Zepp. Fully configurable thresholds (scroll count, time window, cooldown) persisted via `SharedPreferences`. Includes `BootReceiver` for post-reboot resilience. Privacy-first: zero content read — scroll event counts only. Built in `Android Studio`, versioned on `GitHub`, with `Firebase` project integration.

---

### 💧 HydroReminder — Android WorkManager App
> *Kotlin · Jetpack WorkManager · Android Notification API*

Hydration reminder app using Jetpack `WorkManager` for reliable background scheduling and persistent notification delivery — targeting correct behavior across Android battery optimization constraints.

---

### 🌍 [Bukharian Language Learning App](https://github.com/azaurov/SilkRoadDuo) — Duolingo-style
> *Expo · React Native · TypeScript*

Cross-platform mobile app for **Bukharian Judeo-Tajik, Farsi, and Sogdian** — endangered languages with virtually no existing app coverage. Gamified lessons, vocabulary decks, hearts/XP/streaks, and four game modes. CEFR A1–B1 scaffolding.

---

### 🎨 AI Photo Colorization Tool
> *Vanilla JS · Claude Vision API · Canvas API*

Web tool that uses Claude Vision for semantic region detection (sky, skin, foliage, fabric) and Canvas API pixel manipulation to colorize black-and-white photos with luminance-preserving blending. Includes a before/after comparison slider and graceful API-failure fallback to luminance-only mode.

---

### ⚛️ Interactive Quantum Mechanics Simulator
> *React · Expo · Canvas/SVG*

Visualizes wave functions, superposition states, and measurement collapse interactively. Built out of curiosity; shipped because why not.

---

### 📖 Illustrated Ancestral Storybook PDFs
> *Python · ReportLab · Noto Fonts · BiDi/RTL*

Three programmatically generated illustrated PDF storybooks — Bukharian Jewish, Litvak Ashkenazi, and Iberian/Venezuelan ancestral narratives. Solved BiDi Hebrew RTL rendering, multi-script typography (Hebrew / Latin / Cyrillic), and complex multi-column layout challenges in ReportLab.
